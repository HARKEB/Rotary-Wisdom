          <h1>Teenagers set fire to Russian military helicopter in Omsk</h1>
          <p>On September 21, two teenagers in Omsk, Russia, set fire to a Mi-8 helicopter at an airbase using a Molotov cocktail, as reported by the Telegram channel Baza. The 16-year-olds were detained and claimed they were offered $20,000 via Telegram for the attack. The helicopter sustained significant damage.
             This incident follows a similar attack on September 11, when two younger boys ignited a Mi-8 helicopter at Noyabrsk airport in the Tyumen region. Additionally, various sabotage incidents, including train derailments, have occurred throughout Russia. In January, Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) reported that some railway tracks were targeted by "unknown opponents of Putin's regime."</p>
